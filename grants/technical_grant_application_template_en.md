# Technical Grant Proposal

* **Project:** Encentive

## Project Overview  

 * A brief description of the project.

   Encentive.io protocol is a robust and secure DeFi ecosystem platform that allows its users to perform one-click deployment of their own DeFi protocols to monetize their traffic and take advantage of a variety of other cutting-edge features including deployment of LP Pools, Staking Pools, Airdrops, and NFT Marketplaces. The users of the protocol can customize multiple solutions within the ecosystem such as pairs of tradeable assets, native tokens and their supply, and additional incentives for other users in the form of LP fees. Encentive protocol introduces an innovative model of liquidity bonded across all DEXs deployed via the protocol. Thanks to the strategic cooperation between Encentive and AlchemyPay, the protocol enables its partners the deployment of on-ramp/off-ramp features supporting direct transactions using Visa and Mastercard. The protocol’s code has been audited by Peck Shield and Certik.

 * An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.

   Encentive.io is a project-agnostic development tool, which helps not only retail users and development teams to deploy their own customized DeFi solutions but also equips other projects with powerful DeFi features helping them minimize their development expenses. Encentive.io also helps the influencers from the space additionally monetize their efforts by letting them take advantage of owning their own Decentralized Exchange without them enriching 3rd party service providers. There are no preliminary requirements to use the protocol, nor does it require any programming skills or professional knowledge. Our development tool is extremely user-friendly and includes mostly click-and-drop lists of predefined options to choose from. You will also find different kinds of blank fields to fill in, which will later define the key features of your DEXs. 
	We also make it possible for the new projects to establish strategic collaborations in a way that allows the communities behind them directly benefit from it by participating in one-sided staking pools - if you are in X project, you can now stake the Y token and start getting rewarded in X token, and the other way around. We strongly believe this kind of activities creates a stronger bond and engagement not only between the projects but also behind the communities that support them. The newest features of the protocol such as the deployment of one-sided staking pools and community airdrops met with a warm welcome from many projects lacking the resources to deploy their own advanced DeFi solutions.

 * An indication of what benefits will this project bring to the Alaya or PlatON ecosystem

   Encentive.io will allow projects from the PlatOn Ecosystem to deploy the most cutting-edge DeFi features in a timely, efficient and inexpensive manner. More attractive DeFi features will let the projects from the PlatOn Ecosystem become a more feasible alternative for potential investors and users, bringing more traffic and possibly more TVL as a result.

### Project Details

Basic Features
1) ETH and BNB are supported
2) Solidity updates supported up to version 0.8.7

Contract deployment

Deployment order and corresponding relationships are as follows:
1) Deploy ProjectManager and DexInfo first 
2) Use the address of ProjectManager and DexInfo to deploy MultiSwapPool
3) Use the address of ProjectManager to deploy MultiStaker
4) Use the address of MultiSwapPool to deploy EncV2Router01
When debugging, you only need to redeploy the faulty contract itself and its subordinate contracts 

Contract interface 

DexInfo

Read only 
getPool(address ctr, address token0, address token1, uint projectId)
Get the ID of the specific project’s pool (the pool is composed of token 0 and token 1)
ctr is MultiSwapPool contract address  

getPrice(address ctr, address token0, address token1)
Obtain price information. Ctr is MultiSwapPool contract address. The price returned is the same time price credits as Uni V2.
Credit = time * price
(after-trade credit  -  before-trade credit) / time interval 

MultiSwapPool

Mainly used to query swap-related information and add transaction pools
Read only
poolInfos(uint pid) 
Returns the addresses of the two tokens in the pool
projectManager() 
Returns the address of the bound projectManager
claimableReward(uint poolId)
Query the amount of transaction fee that can be claimed by the owner in the specific pool. The units of the two returned values ​​are token0 and token1 respectively.
Write method 
constructor(address pm, uint totalFeeRate, uint otherShare, uint projectShare, uint globalShare) 
Contract constructing function 
Pm is manager address，
totalFeeRate: 	30
otherShare: 	5
projectShare: 	4
globalShare:	20
addPool(address tokenA,address tokenB, uint projectID) 
Create a pool for the specified project 
claimReward(uint poolId,address to)
Receive the rewards that belong to the owner in the specified pool

EncV2Router01

Mainly use swap and liquidity increase/decrease
Read only 
multiSwapPool()
Get the contract address of the corresponding MultiSwap
getAmountOut(uint256 poolID,uint256 amountIn,bool fromToken0)
Same as V2.0, returns the number of tokens that can be obtained after the transaction
getAmountIn(uint256 poolID,uint256 amountOut, bool fromToken0)


Calculates the number of tokens to be transferred based on the expected number of tokens to be swapped. Other parameters are the same as getAmountOut

Query the asset status in the pool and return：
uint120 gReserves0,uint120 gReserves1,uint256 poolLpAmount,uint256 globalLpAmount
where gReserves0, gReserves1 is the balance of the entire connecting liquidity pool，poolLpAmount is this pool’s total of LPs, globalLpAmount is the LP total in the entire connecting liquidity 
WETH()
Get the address of the platform currency Erc20 wrapped contract WETH used in this contract. On Ethereum it is WETH, on BSC it is WBNB. The ERC20 Wrap of the following platforms is abbreviated as WETH. 
Writing method 
swap(uint poolID, uint256 amountIn,uint256 minAmountOut,bool fromToken0,address to,uint deadline)
Same as V2.0, used to exchange one token for another
swapWithETHIn(uint poolID,uint256 minAmountOut,bool fromToken0,address to,uint deadline)
It is used to exchange a platform token (such as BNB on BscMainnet) for another token. The deposit amount is the value parameter specified in the front-end write method. The token deposited in the pool is required to be WETH. 
swapWithETHOut( uint poolID,uint256 amountIn, uint256 minAmountOut,bool fromToken0,address to,uint deadline)
Used to exchange tokens for platform tokens (such as BNB on BscMainnet). The Token exchanged in the pool is required to be WETH
removeLiquidity(uint256 liquidity, uint256 poolID,uint deadline)
Same as V2.0, used to redeem liquidity. The main difference is that you need to use the MultiSwapPool contract (in line with the IMultiERC20 interface) to approve the EncV2Router01 contract
removeLiquidityETH(uint256 liquidity,uint256 poolID,uint deadline) 
Used to redeem liquidity and automatically exchange WETH for a platform currency
addLiquidity(uint poolID, uint256 amount0,  uint256 amount1,uint deadline)
Same as V2.0 for adding liquidity
addLiquidityETH(uint poolID, uint256 amount0,  uint256 amount1,uint deadline)
Automatically convert platform tokens into WETH and add liquidity. The value parameter specified in the front-end write method indicates the amount of platform tokens put in. It is required that one token in the pool is WETH and that the other token has been approved by the router

Multitasker

Compared with V2.0, the main difference is that the created activity is moved to this contract, and the exit method is added.
Write method
addActivity(CreateActivityParams params)
The parameters are the same as V2.0. The main difference is the Multitasker contract, not the original Project Manager, needs to be approved.

exit(address account, uint256 activityId)
For full redemption and claiming rewards
ProjectManager
In the future, it will be used only to store the identity of the project owner, and no longer specific pools or activities created by users. Method to import existing tokens to create projects was added. 

Write method 
createProject2( address projectToken)
Create a project, project native token is projectToken
transferOwnership( uint256 pid, address newOwner )
User for modifying the project owner

Other questions
Regarding BNB and WBNB
1. Obtain the address of WBNB using the WETH method of the router contract
2. When the user selects BNB, select the pool containing WBNB the corresponding method requires to use addLiquidityETH, swapWithETHIn, swapWithETHOut
3. When the user selects WBNB, it is regarded as a common currency operation
4. When redemption adds liquidity, it is treated as BNB by default, so you need to use removeLiquidityETH
